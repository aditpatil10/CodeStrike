              CodeStrike organised an induction for the first year students on 7th September 2017.The entire session was taken care of, by our very own student committee. The aim of this induction was to brief about the programming world to the first year folks and motivate them to be a part of CodeStrike committee. Students from all the branches were invited . With ample of exposure this induction was successful in receiving a huge response .

            <br><br>              

            The induction commenced at 10AM and was split into two sessions.The first half appended CMPN and IT branch students whereas the second slot was attended by the EXTC and ELEC department students.
            <h5>The following topics were expatiated by the organisers:</h5>
            <div style="font-size: 125%">
               <ol>
                  <li>Competitive Coding</li>
                  <li>Website Developement</li>
                  <li>Mobile Application Developement</li>
                  <li>Game Designing</li>
                  <li>Embeded Systems</li>
                  <li>Hacking and Penetration Testing</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <br><br>                   
                Conscious efforts were made by the organisers to keep the session two sided. Informal interaction helped the students overcome their hesitation and cast a doubt on domains being covered . Active participation from students was evident during the enitre induction. In this manner the productivity of the induction attained a different milestone.
